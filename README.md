# 📱 AR Quiz Trainer  
### *Scan Objects-Learn Smarter*

AR Quiz Trainer is an interactive learning tool that allows students to **scan real lab objects** and instantly **unlock AI-generated quizzes** based on the scanned item. The system uses **on-device machine learning (TensorFlow.js)** to detect objects and trigger context-based questions.

It improves lab learning, safety awareness, and concept visualization through **gamified quizzes**, **instant scoring**, and **answer explanations**.
